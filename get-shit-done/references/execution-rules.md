# Execution Rules Reference

Shared rules for plan execution. Referenced by both gsd-executor agent and execute-plan workflow.

---

<deviation_rules>

## Deviation Rules

You WILL discover unplanned work during execution. Apply these rules automatically. Track all deviations for Summary.

**Shared process for Rules 1-3:** Fix inline → add/update tests if applicable → verify fix → continue task → track as `[Rule N - Type] description`

No user permission needed for Rules 1-3.

| Rule | Trigger | Action | Permission |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **1: Bug** | Broken behavior, errors, wrong queries, type errors, security vulns, race conditions, leaks | Fix → test → verify → track `[Rule 1 - Bug]` | Auto |
| **2: Missing Critical** | Missing essentials: error handling, validation, auth, CSRF/CORS, rate limiting, indexes, logging | Add → test → verify → track `[Rule 2 - Missing Critical]` | Auto |
| **3: Blocking** | Prevents completion: missing deps, wrong types, broken imports, missing env/config/files, circular deps | Fix blocker → verify proceeds → track `[Rule 3 - Blocking]` | Auto |
| **4: Architectural** | Structural change: new DB table, schema change, new service, switching libs, breaking API, new infra | STOP → present decision → track `[Rule 4 - Architectural]` | Ask user |

---

**RULE 1: Auto-fix bugs**

**Trigger:** Code doesn't work as intended (broken behavior, errors, incorrect output)

**Examples:** Wrong queries, logic errors, type errors, null pointer exceptions, broken validation, security vulnerabilities, race conditions, memory leaks

---

**RULE 2: Auto-add missing critical functionality**

**Trigger:** Code missing essential features for correctness, security, or basic operation

**Examples:** Missing error handling, no input validation, missing null checks, no auth on protected routes, missing authorization, no CSRF/CORS, no rate limiting, missing DB indexes, no error logging

**Critical = required for correct/secure/performant operation.** These aren't "features" — they're correctness requirements.

---

**RULE 3: Auto-fix blocking issues**

**Trigger:** Something prevents completing current task

**Examples:** Missing dependency, wrong types, broken imports, missing env var, DB connection error, build config error, missing referenced file, circular dependency

---

**RULE 4: Ask about architectural changes**

**Trigger:** Fix requires significant structural modification

**Examples:** New DB table (not column), major schema changes, new service layer, switching libraries/frameworks, changing auth approach, new infrastructure, breaking API changes

**Action:** STOP → return checkpoint with: what found, proposed change, why needed, impact, alternatives. **User decision required.**

**Rule 4 format:**
```
⚠️ Architectural Decision Needed

Current task: [task name]
Discovery: [what prompted this]
Proposed change: [modification]
Why needed: [rationale]
Impact: [what this affects]
Alternatives: [other approaches]

Proceed with proposed change? (yes / different approach / defer)
```

---

**RULE PRIORITY:**
1. Rule 4 applies → STOP (architectural decision)
2. Rules 1-3 apply → Fix automatically
3. Genuinely unsure → Rule 4 (ask)

**Edge cases:**
- Missing validation → Rule 2 (security)
- Crashes on null → Rule 1 (bug)
- Need new table → Rule 4 (architectural)
- Need new column → Rule 1 or 2 (depends on context)

**Heuristic:** "Does this affect correctness, security, or ability to complete task?" YES → Rules 1-3. MAYBE → Rule 4.

</deviation_rules>

<deviation_documentation>

## Documenting Deviations

Summary MUST include deviations section. None? → `## Deviations from Plan\n\nNone - plan executed exactly as written.`

Per deviation: **[Rule N - Category] Title** — Found during: Task X | Issue | Fix | Files modified | Verification | Commit hash

End with: **Total deviations:** N auto-fixed (breakdown). **Impact:** assessment.

</deviation_documentation>

<authentication_gates>

## Authentication Gates

Auth errors during execution are NOT failures — they're expected interaction points.

**Indicators:** "Not authenticated", "Not logged in", "Unauthorized", "401", "403", "Please run {tool} login", "Set {ENV_VAR}"

**Protocol:**
1. Recognize it's an auth gate (not a bug)
2. STOP current task execution
3. Create dynamic checkpoint:human-action with exact auth steps
4. Wait for user to authenticate
5. Verify credentials work
6. Retry original task
7. Continue normally

**Example:** `vercel --yes` → "Not authenticated" → checkpoint asking user to `vercel login` → verify with `vercel whoami` → retry deploy → continue

**In Summary:** Document auth gates as normal flow under "## Authentication Gates", not as deviations.

</authentication_gates>

<checkpoint_protocol>

## Checkpoint Protocol

**CRITICAL: Automation before verification**

Before any `checkpoint:human-verify`, ensure verification environment is ready. If plan lacks server startup before checkpoint, ADD ONE (deviation Rule 3).

For full automation-first patterns, server lifecycle, CLI handling:
**See @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md**

**Quick reference:** Users NEVER run CLI commands. Users ONLY visit URLs, click UI, evaluate visuals, provide secrets. Claude does all automation.

---

When encountering `type="checkpoint:*"`: **STOP immediately.** Return structured checkpoint message using checkpoint_return_format.

**checkpoint:human-verify (90%)** — Visual/functional verification after automation.
Provide: what was built, exact verification steps (URLs, commands, expected behavior).

**checkpoint:decision (9%)** — Implementation choice needed.
Provide: decision context, options table (pros/cons), selection prompt.

**checkpoint:human-action (1% - rare)** — Truly unavoidable manual step (email link, 2FA code).
Provide: what automation was attempted, single manual step needed, verification command.

</checkpoint_protocol>

<checkpoint_return_format>

## Checkpoint Return Format

When hitting checkpoint or auth gate, return this structure:

```markdown
## CHECKPOINT REACHED

**Type:** [human-verify | decision | human-action]
**Plan:** {phase}-{plan}
**Progress:** {completed}/{total} tasks complete

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Name        | Commit | Files                        |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1    | [task name] | [hash] | [key files created/modified] |

### Current Task

**Task {N}:** [task name]
**Status:** [blocked | awaiting verification | awaiting decision]
**Blocked by:** [specific blocker]

### Checkpoint Details

[Type-specific content]

### Awaiting

[What user needs to do/provide]
```

Completed Tasks table gives continuation agent context. Commit hashes verify work was committed. Current Task provides precise continuation point.

</checkpoint_return_format>

<continuation_handling>

## Continuation Handling

If spawned as continuation agent (`<completed_tasks>` in prompt):

1. Verify previous commits exist: `git log --oneline -5`
2. DO NOT redo completed tasks
3. Start from resume point in prompt
4. Handle based on checkpoint type: after human-action → verify it worked; after human-verify → continue; after decision → implement selected option
5. If another checkpoint hit → return with ALL completed tasks (previous + new)

</continuation_handling>

<tdd_execution>

## TDD Execution

For tasks with `tdd="true"` or `type: tdd` plans — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:

**1. Check test infrastructure** (if first TDD task): detect project type, install test framework if needed, verify empty suite runs.

**2. RED:** Read `<behavior>` → create test file → write failing tests → run (MUST fail) → commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**3. GREEN:** Read `<implementation>` → write minimal code to pass → run (MUST pass) → commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**4. REFACTOR (if needed):** Clean up → run tests (MUST still pass) → commit only if changes: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Error handling:** RED doesn't fail → investigate test/existing feature. GREEN doesn't pass → debug, iterate. REFACTOR breaks → undo.

See `~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md` for detailed structure.

</tdd_execution>

<task_commit_protocol>

## Task Commit Protocol

After each task completes (verification passed, done criteria met), commit immediately.

**1. Check modified files:** `git status --short`

**2. Stage task-related files individually** (NEVER `git add .` or `git add -A`):
```bash
git add src/api/auth.ts
git add src/types/user.ts
```

**3. Commit type:**

| Type       | When                                            | Example                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature, endpoint, component                | feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint     |
| `fix`      | Bug fix, error correction                       | fix(08-02): correct email validation regex         |
| `test`     | Test-only changes (TDD RED)                     | test(08-02): add failing test for password hashing |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup, no behavior change (TDD REFACTOR) | refactor(08-02): extract validation to helper      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                         | perf(08-02): add database index                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation                                   | docs(08-02): add API docs                          |
| `style`    | Formatting                                      | style(08-02): format auth module                   |
| `chore`    | Config, tooling, dependencies                   | chore(08-02): add bcrypt dependency                |

**4. Commit format:** `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {concise task description}` with bullet points for key changes:
```bash
git commit -m "{type}({phase}-{plan}): {concise task description}

- {key change 1}
- {key change 2}
"
```

**5. Record hash:**
```bash
TASK_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
TASK_COMMITS+=("Task ${TASK_NUM}: ${TASK_COMMIT}")
```

Track for SUMMARY.
